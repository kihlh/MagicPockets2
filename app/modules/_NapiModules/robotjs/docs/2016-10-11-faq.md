### Does RobotJS support global hotkeys?

Not currently, and I don't know if it ever will. I personally use [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)/[NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) for global hotkeys, and this works well. Later on I might add hotkey support or create a separate module. See [#55](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/55) for details.

### Can I take a screenshot with RobotJS?

Soon! This is a bit more complicated than the rest of the features, so I saved it for last. Luckily the code is already there, I just need to write the bindings, and I've already started. Subscribe to [#13](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/13) for updates.

### Why is &#60;insert key&#62; missing from the keyboard functions?

We've been implementing keys as we need them. Feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request!

### How about multi-monitor support?

The library doesn't have explicit multi-monitor support, so anything that works is kind of on accident. Subscribe to [#88](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/88) for updates.

For any other questions please [submit an issue](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/new).
